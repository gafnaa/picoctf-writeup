# bloat.py

## Description
Can you get the flag?
Run this Python program in the same directory as this encrypted flag.

## Solution
In this code, all string characters are represented as char[i]. I started decoding the strings, starting with the first function arg133.

The first variable arg432 is happychance . This is our password. When we supply it to the program, we get our flag.

This the [program](/bloat.flag.py) that I've been modified.
