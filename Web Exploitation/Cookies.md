## Solution

First, open the available link. After that, input "snickerdoodle" to search for information. It turns out that "snickerdoodle" is one of the "cookies".

Then, try editing the value of the cookies obtained on the website, by using the inspect element in the application section. In the **Value** column, edit by changing the numbers, until you get the flag.
