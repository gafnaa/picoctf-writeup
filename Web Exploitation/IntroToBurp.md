## Solution

First, open the available link, and open the BurpSuite program because the question gives instructions to use that program. After that, fill in the existing form, then on 2FA, turn on **intercept** at BurpSuite to edit the request content.

After submitting on 2FA, delete the ```otp=("the otp you filled in")``` section, to bypass the OTP request.
