# Unminify

## Description

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!
Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:49839/), and find the flag!

## Solution

First, open the link in the description. There is information that we have already got the flag. Then, try to do an **inspect** to check the source code used.
