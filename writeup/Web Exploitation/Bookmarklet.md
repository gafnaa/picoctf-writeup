## Description

Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?
Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:59304/), and find the flag!

## Solution

First open the available link. There is information about the flag, which is a javascript program. Then copy the code, and open the browser console. Then, paste the program there to get the flag
