## Solution

From the website we known that we only can access the flag if we are an admin.
Then, login using random username and you will get your cookies token.

copy that, and paste on jwt.io to do jwt-decoder.

we get this information

```js
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "HS256"
}

{
  "user": "yourname
}
```
change the `user` to `admin`, then encode jwt.

But, we need the signature key, so we must find it first. 
Here, I use `john` to help me brute forcing the signature

copy your original cookies token, then paste on textfile
then, do this command

```js
$ john weakjwt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=HMAC-SHA256
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (HMAC-SHA256 [password is key, SHA256 256/256 AVX2 8x])
Will run 8 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
ilovepico        (?)
1g 0:00:00:01 DONE (2025-03-18 00:10) 0.5813g/s 4305Kp/s 4305Kc/s 4305KC/s ilovetitor..ilovejesus789
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```
so the signature key is : `ilovepico`

Back to jwt.io, put the key on signature section, then encode it.
After you get you jwt, copy and paste on website cookie, then refresh to get flag.
